### Titanic Visualization Using D3.js
by Arif Hikmet Onat Balta

#### Summary
This chart is designed to be a different kind of donut chart. Instead of showing survival rates directly on the chart area, 
this visualization allows users to investigate titanic dataset as they wish. Users are encouraged to click on different 
combinations of features to find the group with the highest survival rate.

#### Design
In my visualization, I used a different type of donut chart and in final version, I used color hue for feature types and
color saturation for survival rate. It can be also said that size visual encoding is used for survival rate. I used a 
simple layout with a white background and avoid using complex components in order to keep the attention. There is a basic
hierarchy in my visualization, in which similar features are listed side by side.

I downloaded the data set from the Vanderbilt University website, which is identical to Kaggle's Titanic data set. 
The only difference is, Kaggle provides Titanic data set in two seperate parts because of it's competition purposes. 
For minimizing data munging time I used Vanderbilt's data set.

After downlading and cleaning the data, I came up with the question "Were some particular passenger groups more likely
to survive than others?", in other words "Can some specific set of features push the survival rate upwards ?"
Next step is to find a way to answer this question by highlighting some patterns so that my story conveys the overall 
message to readers. In other words, I have to create a visualization that is  answering this question, by giving 
information between those passengers who survived and those who died.

I considered using bar charts, which would explain the survival rate but I thought it would be an exploratory visualization 
instead of an explanatory data visualization so I started investigating different kinds of visualizations and came up with
an idea of using a different kind of donut chart. I influenced much from [Kerry Rodden's Sequences Sunburst](http://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426) 
, [Nadieh Bremerâ€™s Text on an Arc](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/bf6d15082ea81ce69b55) and [Mike Bostock's Donut Chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887193) 
visualizations. Instead of narrating one part of the data set, I thought it would be a better idea to allow users to investigate the whole data set. So I created the initial visualization using d3.js, where each arc represents a feature and when these arcs come together, they form a special type of donut chart. Each arc has it's own color and explanation on hover. 

Users can select groups as they wish. After each selection, survival ratio is displayed in the middle of the donut chart. 
It is easy to understand which features are selected and what is the survival ratio of this selection. At this point, 
user can either select additional features or start selecting other diverse combinations.

A preview of the initial visualization can be seen below or on bl.ocks [here](http://bl.ocks.org/onatb/e98d00f27e6d3598df7a)

After getting the feedback, I fixed some things in my visualization:

- Increased the duration of the story, giving users more time to read the whole story and understand the main aim of the visualization
- Added information about survival ratio. Now it indicates the highest ratio and gives more hint to user
- Added color on survival ratio.Red,  if it is below 55%, yellow between 55-80% and green for higher scores.
- Changed the arc text "Best" to "Hint" to make it more understandable.

A preview of my second trial can be seen below or on bl.ocks [here](http://bl.ocks.org/onatb/9fe16602b54a8c285c24)

Lastly, I got such valuable feedback from my project reviewer Daniel and fixed these things:

- Included all necessary paths,
- Added a visual representation of the percent number using another donut chart inside the original one,
- Left the instructions on top of the page so users can easily read and understand the story,
- Changed the color of "Hint" explanation to red in order to draw the readers attention.

Here is the preview of my final trial and it is also available on bl.ocks [here](http://bl.ocks.org/onatb/1050f6013acd22fed4a0)

#### Feedback
I gathered feedback from 3 different people. I asked them:

+ What do you notice in the visualization?
+ What questions do you have about the data?
+ What relationships do they notice?
+ What is the main takeaway from this visualization?
+ Is there something complex in the graphic?

Responses are shown below:

1. Your chart looks good. I understand that it is about Titanic and the survival ratios. I think women are 
more lucky in surviving than other groups. Travelling in a higher class also effects the survival ratio.
My highest score was 96.53%. Am I on the right track? I think you should fix this part and give some more 
feedback to user because I don't know the highest score. It can be 100% or something over 96%. You should inform me.
Still, your visualization looks nice and informative. I didn't know that some groups survived with such a high percent.

2. I couldn't read the very first text displayed on chart because it disappeared so fast. I didn't quite get the main 
thing I guess. It took me a while to understand what the chart is about. As I figured out, your visualization is about 
Titanic and the percent displayed in the middle explains a survival ratio, changing according to my selections. If I 
understood it right, it looks like this is a very interesting chart. You let users to investigate Titanic passengers 
and their survival ratios. I believe it will be a better chart, if you fix the problem I figured out.

3. I liked your visualization. It was so fun playing around with different features and trying to increase the survival ratio.
I knew a bit about the Titanic passengers so it's not a hard thing for me to find the group that has the highest ratio
but you should include more things to "best" option. I mean you should inform people that doesn't know much about titanic.
By the way, it will be better if you change "Best" to "Hint" because "Best" option with giving some hints doesn't make any sense. 
Overall, it's a great visualization about survival ratios of Titanic passengers. I liked the idea of investigating whole thing myself.
I noticed if you were a little girl travelling in first class and with 1 parent, you would survive with a 100% probability. So nice!

Also my project reviewer Daniel gave me a bunch of worthy feedback which is shown below:

- Well done, the visualization renders perfectly. However, it seems that the js, css and data were separated into their own folders after the code was finished since all paths were missing these folders. I had to add the folders to the path in order for the files to load. Most importantly, there should be a visual representation(chart) of the numbers show. First consider being clear about the main goal of the visualization, does it want to compare the correlation of each variable to survival? does it want to display the accumulative effect of the variables? show frequency of passengers that survived? After this, the appropriate chart should be chosen to represent the data, for example, a stacked bar chart, pie chart or dot chart are great ideas for the data at hand. You are free to decide where the chart should appear, I have a nice image of the inner area of the donut to display a pie chart as the reader clicks thru the options. Also you may plot more than one chart type, there is currently plenty of room around the donut as well. Most of the design choices are great, I would just advice to leave the instructions somewhere in the page and not have them fade away completely. Since many readers could have difficulties with their sight or don't speak English as a native tongue, making it somewhat difficult to read it in the given time. If you intent to draw the readers attention consider changing the color or font size.
