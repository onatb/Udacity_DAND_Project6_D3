      <p>
        Although there was some luck involved in surviving, <br>
        some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. <br>
        Try clicking on different features and see the cummulative effect of the variables <br>
        Can you figure out which variable group hikes the survival rate up to 100% ? <br>
        Don't forget "Women and children first!"
